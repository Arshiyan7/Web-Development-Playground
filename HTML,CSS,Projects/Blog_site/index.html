                <h3>Understanding Semantic HTML: Why It Matters</h3>
                <p>Semantic HTML gives meaning to your web pages, not just structure. Instead of relying on endless divs, semantic tags like header, section, and article help browsers, screen readers, and search engines understand your content better. Using semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and long-term maintainability. It also makes your code easier to read and reason about, especially as projects grow larger.</p>

I started by revising HTML with special attention to semantic tags, then moved on to CSS layouts and JavaScript fundamentals. My approach is simple: learn concepts, practice daily, build small projects, and watch experienced developers code along. This structure helps me identify weak areas and improve consistently.</p>

                <h3>Why Mini Projects Are Better Than Just Watching Tutorials</h3>
                <p>Watching tutorials feels productive, but real learning happens when you build things yourself. Mini projects force you to think, make mistakes, and solve problems independently. They reveal gaps in your understanding that tutorials often hide. Even small projects like a blog layout or a to-do app can significantly improve your confidence and problem-solving skills as a developer.</p>
