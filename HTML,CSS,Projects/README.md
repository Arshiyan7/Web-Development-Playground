# HTML & CSS Practice Files + Projects

## Overview
This folder documents my journey in learning HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) through practical, hands-on projects. The focus is on learning by doing rather than theory.

## Contents
- **Concept Files:** Small examples demonstrating specific features such as Flexbox, Grid, media queries, and forms.  
- **Practice Projects:** Self-contained mini-websites or components that combine multiple concepts.  
- **Finalized Projects:** Larger, more complete projects showing applied HTML and CSS principles.

## Goal
The goal of this collection is to illustrate how web design concepts translate into functional, responsive code. Each project serves as both a reference and a record of progress in mastering core front-end development skills.
