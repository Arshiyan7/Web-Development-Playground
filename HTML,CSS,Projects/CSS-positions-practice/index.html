                <h1>David Goggins: Master Your Mind, Defy the Odds</h1>
                <p>
                    David Goggins is a retired U.S. Navy SEAL, an ultra-endurance athlete, and a highly sought-after
                    motivational speaker and author. His life is a testament to the power of mental toughness and
                    self-mastery, chronicled in his best-selling memoir, Can't Hurt Me. He is the only person to
                    complete SEAL training (including three "Hell Weeks"), Army Ranger School, and Air Force Tactical
                    Air Controller training. A former Guinness World Record holder for pull-ups, Goggins has completed
                    over 60 ultra-marathons, triathlons, and ultra-triathlons. His philosophy revolves around the "40%
                    Rule," which asserts that when you think you're done, you're actually only at 40% of your true
                    capability, urging people to embrace suffering and push far past their perceived limits.</p>
