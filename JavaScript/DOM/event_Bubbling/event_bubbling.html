    What is Event Bubbling?

    Event Bubbling Example:
    When you click on the ".child" element, the click event first triggers its own listener,
    then it "bubbles up" to its parent elements — ".childContainer" and then ".container".
    This means events move from the innermost (child) element outward to its ancestors,
    unless stopped using event.stopPropagation().

    Real-Life Analogy:
    Imagine you live in Peshawar (child), which is in Pakistan (childContainer), which is in Asia (container).
    When something happens in Peshawar (like a click event), it’s also part of Pakistan and Asia,
    so the event naturally "bubbles up" — first handled by Peshawar, then Pakistan, then Asia.
    Similarly, clicking the .child element triggers its event first,
    then .childContainer, then .container — unless stopped using event.stopPropagation().

    <div class="container">
        <section class="childContainer">
            <div class="child">This is a child container</div>
        </section>
    </div>
