# JavaScript Practice Files + Projects

## Overview
This folder is dedicated to learning and practicing JavaScript through direct application. It focuses on understanding concepts by writing and testing real code rather than relying solely on theoretical explanations.

## Contents
- **Concept Files:** Focused examples demonstrating specific JavaScript features such as variables, functions, loops, arrays, DOM manipulation, and events.  
- **Practice Files:** Small coding exercises and logic challenges to reinforce key concepts.  
### Note
The core logic and implementation were developed by the user.  
AI assistance was used to refine code readability, improve structure, and add professional documentation comments.
- **Projects:** Complete scripts or mini-applications combining multiple concepts into practical use cases.

## Goal
The goal of this folder is to provide a structured path for mastering JavaScript fundamentals and applying them in real-world projects. Each file contributes to building stronger problem-solving and coding skills.
