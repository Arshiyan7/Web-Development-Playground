# Remaining HTML Tags and Concepts  

This folder is dedicated to practicing the **remaining HTML tags** and additional concepts not covered in the main practice project.  

### Concepts To Be Explored  
- **Less common HTML tags**: `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<canvas>`, `<iframe>`, `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<meter>`, `<progress>`, etc.  
- **Semantic HTML**: `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`.  
- **Forms in depth**: input types, attributes, validation.  
- **Media embedding and accessibility features**.  

The goal of this folder is to ensure a **complete understanding of HTML** beyond the basics, giving room for experiments, exploration, and advanced use cases.
