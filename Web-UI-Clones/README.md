# Google-LinkedIn-Twitter UI Components  

In this practice file, we recreated **UI elements** inspired by real-world websites like Google, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  

### Concepts Practiced  
- **HTML Basics**: headings, inputs, buttons, and images.  
- **CSS Styling**:  
  - Customizing input fields (Google-style search box).  
  - Designing buttons with hover transitions (LinkedIn sign-in button, Twitter tweet button).  
  - Using `border-radius` for rounded shapes (buttons & profile picture).  
  - Applying `box-shadow` for realistic UI depth.  
  - Layout styling for profile image and text fields.  

This exercise gave hands-on practice in replicating **modern UI components** from popular platforms.
