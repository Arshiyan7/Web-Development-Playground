# Personal Portfolio Website

This folder contains the code and assets for my personal portfolio website.

The goal of this project is to create a **clean, simple, and easy-to-navigate** website that showcases my work, skills, and projects. Instead of focusing on flashy animations, the design emphasizes clarity and professionalism so recruiters and potential collaborators can quickly understand my capabilities.

Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!
