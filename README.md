# Web Development Resources

This repository is a collection of resources, notes, and code snippets that I gather throughout my journey in web development. It will serve as a personal knowledge base as I explore both front-end and back-end technologies on my path to becoming a full-stack developer.

## Purpose
- Organize and store useful web development resources  
- Keep track of concepts, tools, and best practices  
- Document progress and learning as I build skills across the stack  

## Structure
The repository may include:
- Front-end resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks)  
- Back-end resources (databases, APIs, server-side frameworks)  
- Tools, libraries, and utilities that support development  
- Notes, references, and guides  

## Goal
By maintaining this repository, I aim to create a structured and accessible space for continuous learning and growth as a full-stack developer.
