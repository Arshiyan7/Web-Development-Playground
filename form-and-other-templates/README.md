# Sign-Up, Uber Registration, and Facebook Requests UI  

In this practice file, we recreated **UI components** inspired by forms and social media interfaces.  

### Concepts Practiced  
- **HTML Structure**: inputs, buttons, images, and headings.  
- **CSS Styling**:  
  - Customizing input fields with padding, rounded corners, and consistent font usage.  
  - Designing interactive buttons with `hover` and `active` states.  
  - Using `box-shadow` for depth on images.  
  - Aligning layouts with `inline-block` and little bit of`flexbox`.  
- **UI Design Elements**:  
  - Sign-up form (name, email, and sign-up button).  
  - Uber-style ride registration form with pickup, destination, and request options.  
  - Facebook-style friend request cards with profile images, mutual friend info, and add friend button.  

This exercise provided hands-on practice in replicating **real-world UI elements** and building reusable, structured web components.
