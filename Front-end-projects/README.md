# Front-End Projects

This repository contains a collection of front-end projects built to strengthen and demonstrate my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Each project focuses on practical, real-world use cases and helps improve problem-solving, code structure, and development workflow.

The goal of this repository is not only to create complete applications but also to build small, focused projects that reinforce core front-end concepts and modern development practices.

## Purpose

These projects are designed to help me:

- Practice core front-end technologies  
- Improve JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation  
- Learn how to structure real-world projects  
- Identify and eliminate weaknesses  
- Apply modern development patterns  
- Build consistency through hands-on development  

Each project represents a step forward in understanding how real applications are built and maintained.
