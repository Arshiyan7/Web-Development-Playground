# Youtube-Clone Project  

In this practice project, we are building a **YouTube clone UI** by recreating **UI elements** similar to layouts used in platforms like Google, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  

### Concepts Practiced  
- **HTML Basics**: input fields, images, headings, and paragraphs.  
- **CSS Styling**:  
  - Designing a **search bar** with rounded edges (Google-style).  
  - Structuring a **video preview card** with nested `<div>` elements.  
  - Styling profile pictures with `border-radius` for a circular look.  
  - Applying typography and spacing to mimic real-world video info sections.  

### Layout Techniques  
- **Inline-block**: Initially used for horizontal layouts.  
- **Grid**: Introduced for better control over two-dimensional layouts.  
- **Flexbox**: To be used for responsive one-dimensional layouts.  
- **Positioning**: Absolute and relative positioning for detailed UI placement.  
- **Nested Layouts**: Combining multiple layout techniques for complex structures.  

### Project Goal  
By the end of the HTML and CSS practice, we will have built a **YouTube clone UI**. As we move forward, weâ€™ll integrate more tools and techniques such as **Flexbox, Grid, advanced selectors, pseudo-classes, and responsive design** to make it look closer to real-world applications.
