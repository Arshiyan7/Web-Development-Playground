# Google-LinkedIn-Twitter UI Components  

In this practice file, we recreated **UI elements** inspired by YouTubeâ€™s video preview layout, similar to UI components found on Google, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  

### Concepts Practiced  
- **HTML Basics**: input fields, images, headings, and paragraphs.  
- **CSS Styling**:  
  - Designing a **search bar** with rounded edges (Google-style).  
  - Structuring a **video preview card** with nested `<div>` elements.  
  - Applying **horizontal and vertical layouts** using `inline-block` and `block`.  
  - Styling profile pictures with `border-radius` for a circular look.  
  - Using typography and spacing to mimic real-world video info sections (title, channel name, stats).  

This exercise provided practical experience in replicating **modern video preview layouts** using **nested divs** and CSS positioning.
