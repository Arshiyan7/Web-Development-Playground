# Amazon-Nike Template  

In this practice file, we created a simple product display layout inspired by an e-commerce product page.  

### Concepts Practiced  
- **HTML Basics**: headings, paragraphs, images, links, and buttons.  
- **CSS Styling**:  
  - Setting margins, fonts, and colors.  
  - Hover and active states for buttons (`:hover`, `:active`).  
  - Styling links with custom colors and hover effects.  
  - Using `border-radius` for rounded buttons.  
  - Basic layout control with `margin` and `width/height` on images.  

This exercise helped practice how **product cards** are commonly styled in online shopping websites.
