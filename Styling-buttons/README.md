# Buttons styling 

In this section, we practiced creating and styling different types of buttons with interactive effects.  

### Concepts Practiced  
1. **Pagination Buttons**  
   - Styling navigation buttons like **Back** and **Next** with spacing using `margin-left` and `margin-right`.  

2. **Stretch Button**  
   - Learned how to increase button size on hover using `padding-top`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`, and `padding-right`.  
   - This makes it clear for beginners that each padding side can be controlled individually, instead of using a single shorthand `padding` with four values.  

3. **3D Click Button**  
   - Used `box-shadow` to give a 3D effect.  
   - On click (`:active`), the button shifts position slightly and removes the shadow to simulate pressing.  

4. **Number Buttons**  
   - Practiced hover effects with scaling (`transform: scale`) and background color changes.  
   - Demonstrated how multiple buttons can share the same style with a common class.  

This section was mainly about **button interactivity, spacing, and hover effects** that enhance user experience.
